# Nodecore

---

## What is Nodecore

nodecore is a fault-tolerant RPC load balancer designed to work with any blockchain API. It intelligently distributes requests across multiple providers or nodes, with a focus on optimizing performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and error rates.

> **⚠️ Project status**: nodecore is still under active development. Expect frequent updates and improvements as the project evolves.

## Key features

- **Intelligent routing**: dynamically selects the most suitable upstream based on real-time performance metrics (latency, error rate, availability). This ensures optimal speed, reliability, and fault-tolerance
- **Multi-protocol RPC support**:
  - EVM and Solana JSON-RPC over HTTP and WebSocket
    - Supports all standard EVM and Solana RPC methods
    - Handles EVM filter methods (eth_newFilter, eth_getFilterLogs, etc.) by routing them only to the upstream where the filter was created
    - Supports all EVM and Solana subscription types
  - All methods and their settings are defined in the method [specs](pkg/methods/specs)
  - Unsupported methods are automatically banned per upstream to prevent unnecessary requests
  - Planned support for additional networks and protocols (REST, gRPC, etc.)
- **Efficient cache system**: Minimizes redundant traffic by caching frequent requests and reducing load on upstream providers
- **Customizable selection policies**: Offers flexible configuration for defining custom provider selection logic based on specific metrics and preferences
- **Streaming-first architecture**: Responses can be streamed to minimize memory footprint and handle large payloads efficiently
- **Failsafe mechanisms**: Built-in resilience features to ensure continuity under failure conditions, such as:
  - Request hedging – duplicate requests to multiple upstreams to mitigate slow responses
  - Automatic retries – configurable retries for failed requests
- **Flexible authentication**: Supports multiple authentication strategies, such as:
  - Token-based and JWT authentication for standard access control
  - Scoped access keys with fine-grained restrictions, such as IP whitelists, method whitelists, and contract address whitelists — allowing tighter limits per application

## Quick start

Use `docker run -p 9090:9090 -v /path/to/config:/nodecore.yml drpcorg/nodecore`.

## Build from source

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drpcorg/nodecore.git
```

2. **Install Go dependencies:**

```bash
make setup
```

3. Create your own configuration file. Use ./nodecore.yml as a template. Replace the example URLs with your own upstream providers.

4. Run with docker:

   - Build the image `docker build -t nodecore:latest .`
   - Run the container with your local config `docker run -v ${/path/to/config}/nodecore-local.yml:./nodecore-local.yml nodecore:latest`

5. Run locally:

   - Generate chain info based on the public repo https://github.com/drpcorg/public `make generate-networks`
   - Start the service `make run`. **Note**: it will use the basic config file `./nodecore.yml`. If you want to specify your own one, run the following command: `NODECORE_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/your/config make run`

6. Send you first request:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:9090/queries/ethereum' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params": [
        "latest",
        false
    ]
}'
```

After configuring matching upstreams, Bitcoin and Tron can be queried through their chain endpoints as well:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:9090/queries/bitcoin' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getblockcount","params":[]}'
```

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:9090/queries/tron' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[]}'
```

Bitcoin exposes node-safe public RPC methods by default. Wallet and admin methods can still be exposed per upstream through the existing `methods.enable` config.

For detailed documentation [see](docs/nodecore)

## Integrations

Nodecore can be integrated with other services to provide additional functionality. For example, with DRPC. For more information, see [Integrations](docs/nodecore/09-integration.md).

## Special Deployments

### Running NodeCore as a Tor Hidden Service

NodeCore can be deployed as a Tor hidden service (.onion) to provide anonymous and censorship-resistant access to blockchain RPC endpoints.

**Quick start with Tor:**

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up -d
cat tor-data/hostname  # Get your .onion address
```

For complete setup instructions, security considerations, and troubleshooting, see:

- [Tor Setup Guide](docs/nodecore/07-tor-setup.md)


# Nodecore Helm Chart

The Helm chart and instructions for deploying **nodecore** to Kubernetes are located in [`chart/nodecore`](./chart/nodecore) in this repository 
and are published as an OCI artifact to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
